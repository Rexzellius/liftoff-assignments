# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The project of choice will involve skills deriving from what the collective Codergirls have learned in the Java track about establishing thymeleaf, models and modelbinding, and model validation. Whilst also delving further into uploading an organized calender list of clients to display their appointments accordingly. With every new spa opening up in either a remote or bustling city, they may require some assistance and recruit a professional who bears the necessary skills for the job of creating a functioning website. It is deterimental to also keep authentication secured with hashing passwords into encrypted code, not save them as plain text. In addition, the spa's clients' data will be saved in MySQL to keep a constant record of appointments, hashed passwords, general information, and their choice of manicure or pedicure with facial treatments given depending on the client's skin type. The users may also leave feedback on the website's review page whenever they are logged in.

This idea derived from learning about the aforementioned chapters 11-13. They were all fragmented cornerstones into establishing a "psuedo website", that allowed limited interactability. However, with each studio tying together their lesson, it helped to give a clear view on what attributes or models (for reference) that would be used in a professional environment. In addition to future studios that were touched on in class, this ManiPedi studio will transform into a fully-fledged project conceived from a fictional spa business.
### Features
    -Search: Able to look through products used by the store, and purchase if necessary.
    -Login: Users must login in order to create an appointment with the business of choice.
    -Create: Users can leave helpful feedback about the business itself. Critics are welcomed.
    -Delete: Users may delete their feedback in case they needed to change their mind or their opinion.
    -Organization: Users can review the website's built-in calendar to see the time of date of their appointment.
    -Upload: Upload photos (i.e. account user's avatar, photo of the business and its location).
### Technologies
    -Java
    -Spring Boot
    -MySQL
    -Hibernate
    -Thymeleaf templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
What has already been listed under the technologies is what I am fairly familiar with in terms of making a cohesive "psuedo website". However, there was one instance of a studio's bonus mission requiring Codergirls to find a way to upload an image from our own computers. That I have reviewed but not implemented in the code. That, and having the necessary attributes to create the model when needing to display what the redirect link will be. Say, redirecting to a login page, and having the user login. Those will need to be touched on again; the LaunchCode Java Web Development book is bookmarked, in case I need more reminders. There is also still the connection between MySQL and LocalHost:8080, or perhaps whatever else we may be using in the professional field if not Spring Boot. Otherwise, I can understand the concepts of authorization, authentication, model-binding and model validation, as well as inheritance and polymorphism.

Fortunately a lot of Java video tutorials have been saved into a video catalogue, the main focus is building a website from scratch, since while I can understand why this function does what, exercising my brain to create the website as a whole would defeinitely need a couple more refreshers -- and new ideas that can save time and keep my code DRY.
